### Preparation and set up

While it is possible to write a perfectly functional website with something like notepad, it's not going to be easy, so we recommend installing an Integrated Development Editor (IDE) to make things easier for ourselves. (Some people say programmers are lazy and that we spend our time making things easy for ourselves. I'd disagree with them, but I can't be bothered...) Anyway, back to the setup. If you've already installed Visual Studio (VS) Code from a previous tutorial, then you can skip this (yay!) but if not, then head over to the [Visual Studio Code Download Page](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) and then click on the download link for the operating system you're working on.

When that's downloaded, open the installer and follow the instructions to install the editor. By default, VS Code is all ready for writing HTML with some nice auto complete features to help with the names of tags and their associated attributes. (We'll explain what tags and attributes are later.)
